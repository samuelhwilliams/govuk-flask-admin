# TODO

- Work out how to support different versions of GOV.UK Frontend
- Maybe rethink baking GOV.UK Frontend assets into this extension directly - but what's a better option if we need to extend GOV.UK Frontend with custom functionality+styling?
- think more about i18n/l10n
- edit models
- delete models
- think about how to handle model (bulk) actions (done with checkboxes in original flask-admin)

## UI

- Searching/Filtering results
- Exporting results
- Fileadmin (s3)
- Pagesize
- Form actions
- fix pagination
- sorting columns
- add --numeric classes if model fields are numeric
