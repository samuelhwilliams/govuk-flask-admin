# TODO

## High priority

- Move the navigation bar to the top (service navigation? might require dropdowns which would mean JS which would 
  mean sad)
- Make model list views use MoJ filter component w/ actions menu
- Refine layout of all of the views

## Other

- Work out how to support different versions of GOV.UK Frontend
- Maybe rethink baking GOV.UK Frontend assets into this extension directly - but what's a better option if we need to extend GOV.UK Frontend with custom functionality+styling?
- think more about i18n/l10n
- think about performance for large/extra large tables
- make default error messages (eg for Unique, InputRequired, IntegerField) more GOVUK-style/accessible.

## UI

- Fileadmin (s3)
