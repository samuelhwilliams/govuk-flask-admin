# TODO

- Work out how to support different versions of GOV.UK Frontend
- Maybe rethink baking GOV.UK Frontend assets into this extension directly - but what's a better option if we need to extend GOV.UK Frontend with custom functionality+styling?
- think more about i18n/l10n
- edit models
- delete models
- think about how to handle model (bulk) actions (done with checkboxes in original flask-admin)
- think about performance for large/extra large tables
- make default error messages (eg for Unique, InputRequired, IntegerField) more GOVUK-style/accessible.

## UI

- DISPLAY PAGE_SIZE OPTIONS
- Searching/Filtering results
- Exporting results
- Fileadmin (s3)
- Form actions
- Fix sidebar css (sidebar and subnav are basically tightly coupled, make them the same thing?)
